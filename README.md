# ExoplanetML: Exoplanet Target Variable Prediction using Machine Learning 

This app allow users to build a machine learning (ML) model for Exoplanet target variable prediction in an end-to-end workflow. This encompasses data upload, data pre-processing, ML model building and post-model analysis. The user might need to do some a priori data curation.

## Demo App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://exoplanetaiml.streamlit.app/)

## How to Use:

To work with the app, go to the sidebar: 1. Select a dataset (if you are uploading your own csv, it might require a bit of curation. Make sure the target variable is the last column and the file contains features relevant for the prediction); 2. Adjust the model parameters using the slider widgets. As a result, this would initiate the ML model building process, display the model results as well as allowing users to download the generated models and accompanying data.
